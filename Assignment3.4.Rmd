#3. Implement user defined functions, within apply function using the mtcars data set
# and produce  column wise summary statistics using apply function 
#get mean of all variables
apply(mtcars, 2, mean)
# get the mean of the mpg column grouped by cylinders 
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)

               list(mean = apply(mtcars, 2, mean),

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
